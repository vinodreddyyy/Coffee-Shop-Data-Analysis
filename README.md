# Coffee Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of coffee sales data using Excel. The aim is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to uncover key insights about sales patterns. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using pivot charts.

## Objectives

- Perform EDA and feature engineering on coffee sales data.
- Create meaningful visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
- Derive actionable insights from the data.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Conditional Column Creation
- Created a new column categorizing products as "Large," "Small," "Regular," and "Not Defined" based on specific criteria.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked the length of entries in the product detail column and trimmed any extra spaces to ensure data consistency.

### 3. Total Amount Calculation
- Added a new column to calculate the total amount for each transaction by multiplying the transaction quantity with the unit price.

### 4. Transaction Time Extraction
- Extracted the transaction time from the datetime column, separating the date and time for better analysis.

### 5. Sorting by Weekday and Month
- Sorted the data by weekday and month to facilitate trend analysis over different periods.

### 6. Pivot Charts Creation
- Created various pivot charts to visualize the data and uncover patterns.

## Insights Derived

### 1. Sales Variation by Day and Hour
- Analyzed how sales vary by the day of the week and the hour of the day to identify peak sales times.

### 2. Peak Sales Times
- Identified peak times for sales activity to optimize staffing and inventory management.

### 3. Monthly Sales Revenue
- Calculated the total sales revenue for each month to understand seasonal trends and plan promotions.

### 4. Sales Variation by Store Location
- Compared sales across different store locations to identify high-performing and low-performing stores.

### 5. Average Price/Order per Person
- Determined the average price per order per person to understand customer spending behavior.

### 6. Best-Selling Products
- Identified the best-selling products in terms of quantity and revenue to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

### 7. Sales by Product Category and Type
- Analyzed how sales vary by product category and type to identify popular and less popular items.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the sales patterns of coffee products. The analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, optimizing inventory, and planning marketing strategies. The use of Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization proved to be effective in uncovering important trends and patterns.
